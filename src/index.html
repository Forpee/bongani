                    <p>The gradual roll-out of e-Learning is an integral part of the much-spoken-about 4th Industrial Revolution. It is a strategy that will transform education and change pedagogy to improve teaching and learning so that learners achieve
                        better, but are also better equipped for the 21st century world of work, study and living. Enhanced learning is the ultimate outcome of any e-Learning strategy which must be based on a comprehensive blueprint and execution framework.

                <h1 class='d-subheading'>THE SCIENCE OF DELIVERING RESULTS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR</h1>
                <p class='d-p'>Ultimately, governments exist to deliver results to their citizens, but delivering meaningful results is easier said than done. This is especially true when faced with large and complicated bureaucracies required to make inroads on large-scale
                    service delivery objectives. Deliverology is credited to Michael Barber who discovered a repeatable methodology for achieving real impact in government. Today, deliverology has been duplicated around the world with dozens of delivery
                    units being established in dozens of countries.</p>
                <br />
                <p class='d-p'>Deliverology is about nothing more and nothing less than building systems that allow a leader in government to ask and answer these questions consistently and rigorously in order to focus on outcomes.

                    <p class='tech-p'>Lack of project oversight, access to activity reports and reliable audit trails can quickly make a large-scale project feel overwhelming. Balancing the planning, execution and reporting requirement inherent in all projects is what
                        maintains the vital balance between project deliverables within a set budget and timeline, and this ultimately spells project success.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p class='tech-p'>As we think about what makes up an ERP system we should consider the project lifecycle. The ERP should have all the elements of the lifecycle as a basic part of the system.</p>
